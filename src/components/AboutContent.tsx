            PhageKenya is a consortium of researchers that engage in phage research in Kenya. This consortium's main aim is to create a one-health community building repositories of phages to formulate biological products, highlight phage research, and advocate for their safe use in animal, food industries, and healthcare.

            Efforts to position Kenya in the world of phage research has been boosted by a pool of scientists trained both in Kenya and abroad. Phages for Global Health has been instrumental in building capacity for phage research by training several African scientists through organized workshops.

            Microbial drug resistance is a global challenge as it affects the one-health community which includes the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants, and the environment. This microbial drug resistance threatens to rescind the gains that have been achieved in the science of treatment, infection prevention and healing, threatening the quality and longevity of the affected life-forms and the overall wellbeing and economic potential of humanity.

            Phages have the potential to address the global challenge of multidrug resistance (MDR) and provide efficacious solutions to this health challenge. Phages are abundant in nature and specific to their bacterial hosts; therefore, concerted efforts are required to consolidate strategies and pool resources to make them a therapeutic, environmental decontamination, and food safety resource.

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-6">
            Phages can be identified to target priority bacterial human and animal pathogens and restore quality of life for those with limited or no antibiotic alternatives rescuing healthcare systems globally from a catastrophic collapse.
