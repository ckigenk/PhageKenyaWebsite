    abstract: 'Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) is a growing cause of nosocomial and antibiotic-resistant infections. Treating drug-resistant E. faecalis requires novel approaches. The use of bacteriophages (phages) against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria has recently garnered global attention. Biofilms play a vital role in E. faecalis pathogenesis as they enhance antibiotic resistance. Phages eliminate biofilms by producing lytic enzymes, including depolymerases. In this study, Enterococcus phage vB_Efs8_KEN04, isolated from a sewage treatment plant in Nairobi, Kenya, was tested against clinical strains of MDR E. faecalis. This phage had a broad host range against 100% (26/26) of MDR E. faecalis clinical isolates and cross-species activity against Enterococcus faecium. It was able to withstand acidic and alkaline conditions, from pH 3 to 11, as well as temperatures between −80 °C and 37 °C. It could inhibit and disrupt the biofilms of MDR E. faecalis. Its linear double-stranded DNA genome of 142,402 bp contains 238 coding sequences with a G + C content and coding gene density of 36.01% and 91.46%, respectively. Genomic analyses showed that phage vB_Efs8_KEN04 belongs to the genus Kochikohdavirus in the family Herelleviridae. It lacked antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and lysogeny genes, and its stability, broad host range, and cross-species lysis indicate strong potential for the treatment of Enterococcus infections.',

    abstract: 'Non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica infections are one of the leading causes of diarrhoeal diseases that spread to humans from animal sources such as poultry. Hence, keeping poultry farms free of Salmonella is essential for consumer safety and for a better yield of animal products. However, the emergence of antibiotic resistance due to over usage has sped up the search for alternative biocontrol methods such as the use of bacteriophages. Isolation and characterization of novel bacteriophages are key to adapt phage-based biocontrol applications. Here, we isolated and characterized Salmonella phages from samples collected at chicken farms and slaughterhouses in Kenya. The genomic characterization of these phage isolates revealed that they belong to four ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) phage genera. All these phages are lytic and possibly suitable for biocontrol applications because no lysogenic genes or virulence factors were found in their genomes. Hence, we recommend further studies on these phages for their applications in Salmonella biocontrol.',

    abstract: 'While the global community was shocked by the impact of COVID-19 and the 3.56 million deaths it caused worldwide in 2021, the pandemic of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was already linked to even more deaths each year.1 Indeed, a recent study estimated that in 2019, 4.95 million deaths were associated with bacterial AMR—and by 2050, the death toll from AMR is expected to rise to 10 million annually.2,3 Predictions indicate that the African continent will have the highest AMR per capita mortality rate globally, with 4.15 million deaths expected there. This is likely due to misuse of antibiotics in both people and animals around the world, combined with the natural ability of bacteria to evolve. Since antibiotics are failing to kill pathogenic bacteria at alarmingly increasing rates, antibiotic alternatives such as bacteriophages (phages) are urgently needed worldwide, but particularly in Africa',

    abstract: 'Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica Enteritidis is one of the major causes of foodborne illnesses worldwide. This non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) serovar is mainly transmitted to humans through poultry products. Bacteriophages (phages) offer an alternative to antibiotics for reducing the incidence of MDR NTS in poultry farms. Phages that survive the harsh environment of the chicken gastrointestinal tract (cGIT), which have low pH, high temperatures, and several enzymes, may have a higher therapeutic or prophylactic potential. In this study, we analysed the stability of 10 different S. Enteritidis phages isolated from Kenyan poultry farms in different pH-adjusted media, incubation temperatures, as well as simulated gastric and intestinal fluids (SGF and SIF, respectively). Furthermore, their ability to persist in water sources available in Kenya, including river, borehole, rain and tap water, was assessed. All phages were relatively stable for 12 h at pHs ranging from 5 to 9 and at temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 42 °C. At pH 3, a loss in viral titre of up to three logs was observed after 3 h of incubation. In SGF, phages were stable for 20 min, after which they started losing infectivity. Phages were relatively stable in SIF for up to 2 h. The efficacy of phages to control Salmonella growth was highly reduced in pH 2- and pH 3-adjusted media and in SGF at pH 2.5, but less affected in SIF at pH 8. River water had the most significant detrimental effect on phages, while the other tested waters had a limited impact on the phages. Our data suggest that these phages may be administered to chickens through drinking water and may survive cGIT to prevent salmonellosis in poultry.',
