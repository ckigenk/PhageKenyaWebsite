    bio: "Dr. Angela Makumi is a Scientist specialized in the field of microbiology, molecular biology, and bacteriophage biology. Prior to joining ILRI in 2019, Angela was a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Microbiology at the University College Cork, Ireland studying phage-host interactions and how these interactions affect the dairy industry. Angela holds a Ph.D. in Bioscience Engineering from the University of KU Leuven, Belgium, an MSc. in Molecular Biology from the Vrije Universiteit Brussels, Belgium, and a BSc. in Medical Microbiology from the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology- Nairobi, Kenya.  Angela has many years of experience studying the molecular biology of bacteria and bacteriophage interactions.  She is currently working at ILRI on the use of bacteriophages as a One Health approach for the replacement of antibiotics, and reduction of drug-resistant nontyphoidal Salmonella, in poultry farms in Kenya. Been keen on AMR, she is also working on using bacteriophage-based poultry vaccines to curb Salmonella- a project that is funded by IVVN and IDRC. Her research interests revolve around zoonotic diseases, bacterial vaccines, innovations as alternatives to antibiotics, phage-host interactions, phage therapy, and applied research for development with a focus on Low and middle countries.",

    bio: "Dr. Atunga Nyachieo is currently the Chief of Research, Institute of Primate Research (IPR), Nairobi, Kenya. Dr. Nyachieo is a molecular biologist & biochemist. He has a BSc in Biochemistry from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (1999) in Kenya; an MSc in Molecular Biology from KULeuven, Belgium (2014) and a PhD in Biomedical Sciences (Mechanisms of Human Diseases) from KULeuven, Belgium (2010). Dr. Nyachieo’s research career focuses pathogenesis of human diseases (Reproductive diseases & Virology). Since 2015, Dr. Nyachieo started to focus on bacteriophages (also called phages which are viruses that kill bacteria) mainly as therapy against drug resistant bacteria. Since then, Dr. Nyachieo has been leading leads a phage team (called IPR phage hunters). So far his phage team has published n=15 papers and have isolated phages against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia. Dr. Nyachieo has participated in the two East African phage training workshops (1 st workshop in Makerere University, Uganda, 2017; 2 nd Workshop at Pwani University, Kilifi, Kenya, 2018) amongst others.

    bio: "My research interest has been centred around the development of diagnostics for medically important human pathogens, particularly viruses. A highlight of my work was the application of the unique single- chain camelid antibodies in development of a detection method for Chikungunya virus infections in Kenya. My research has been interdisciplinary intersecting with biochemistry, immunology, molecular biology and virology. In recent years I have become increasingly interested in viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophages), as they hold promise as effective antimicrobial agents against pathogenic bacteria, particularly the antibiotic- resistant strains. I aspire to exploit the potential of bacteriophage biology, genomics and engineering to create useful recombinants and products for applications in phage therapy, vaccines and biocontrol of bacteria.",

    bio: "Ms Ivy Mutai is a Research Fellow and Bacteriophage Specialist at the Institute of Primate Research (IPR), Nairobi, Kenya. She is also a Phage Expert & Consultant with the U.S. Army Medical Research Directorate-Africa (USAMRD-A). Her research area focuses on infectious diseases under one health umbrella (human, animal and environmental health). As a graduate student in 2017, Ivy developed passion for phages (which are viruses that infect and replicate inside a bacteria). This was towards finding a long-term solution to the rise in antimicrobial resistance. During this period, Ivy has been working with the support and supervision of the Director of Research, IPR, Dr. Atunga Nyachieo. Through the phage program, Ivy has successfully trained at least 200 undergraduate students from various higher learning institutions across Kenya with hands-on phage isolation skills and expertise while creating awareness on antimicrobial resistance. This training has so far yielded to 4 MSc students, 2 PhD students from Sub-Saharan Africa. The program has been focusing on isolation of lytic phages against multidrug resistant bacteria of medical relevance such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa etc. Additionally, the program is not limited to extend its scope to other fields such as Agriculture and Ecology. Ivy was among the participants in the 2 nd East Africa Phages for Global Health (PGH) that was held at Pwani University, Kilifi, Kenya (2018). Following the PGH hands-on training, she founded a weekly phage discussion forum called IPR phage hunters at their center with the aim of enriching phage enthusiasts on the current phage trends and their applicability. She has also participated and presented her phage research work in several workshops including the 1 st Kenyan Bacteriophage Symposium held in Nairobi, Kenya, (2022) and the World Phage Week held in Ibadan (2022). She is also the team lead of the Kenya Phage Researchers Group (PhageKenya) which aims at bringing together phage enthusiasts to collaborate, network and share more ideas in the phage field and multidisciplinary sectors. In addition, Ivy has won the Phage Recognition and Achievement award through the Evergreen State College, United States, and the Institute of Primate Research, (2018). This was based on her excellent work for mentorship through successful and continuous training phage participants in the Phage Lab Training Program at the Institute of Primate Research and other biomedical research institutions across Sub- Saharan Africa.",
